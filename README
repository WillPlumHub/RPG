This is a personal project where I plan on creating a simple, old school, turn based RPG inspired by the original
Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.

The player will be presented with a command menu and the ability to type their desired command into it.

I may also add the option to select an option from the menu by using the arrow keys, but I kinda like having to type
the commands out yourself, so maybe that'll be the primary option.

I will add more to this README as the project develops and more detail that could use explaining come up.
